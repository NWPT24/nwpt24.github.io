<span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;" >_Energy Efficiency in Programming Languages_</span>
  <span style="display: none;"><br>
    <b>Affiliation:</b> University of Minho and HASLab / INESC TEC, Portugal<br>
    <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will compare a large set of programming languages regarding their energy efficiency.  We have taken 19 solutions to well defined programming problems, expressed in (up to) 27 programming languages, from well know repositories such as the Computer Language Benchmark Game and Rosetta Code.<br>
	In our research, my group built a framework to automatically, and systematically, run, measure and compare the efficiency of such solutions. Ultimately, it is based on such comparison that we propose a serious of efficiency rankings, based on multiple criteria.<br>
	Our results show interesting findings, such as, slower/faster languages consuming less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We also show how to use our results to provide software engineers support to decide which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern.<br>
	In this talk I will also  present our most recent results on leveraging power caps to save energy consumption across programming languages.<br>
    <b>Biography:</b> João Saraiva is an Associate Professor at the Department of de Informatics, University of  Minho, Braga, Portugal, and a researcher member of HASLab/INESC TEC. He obtained a MSc degree from University do Minho in 1993 and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Utrecht University in 1999. His main research contributions have been in the field of programming language design and implementation, program analysis and transformation, functional programming, and green software.  He has experience in participating and coordinating research projects in his research areas, both at national level with projects funded by FCT (projects: PURe, IVY, AMADEUS, CROSS, SSaaPP, AutoSeer, FATBIT, and GreenSwLab) and at international level with projects funded by EPSRC (UK), FLAD/NSF (USA) and by the European Union.<br>
	João Saraiva is one of the founders of the successful series of summer schools on Generative and Transformational Techniques in Software Engineering (GTTSE), which he co-organized in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2015 (volumes 4143, 5235, 6491, 7680 and 10223 of LNCS - Tutorial by Springer-Verlag) in Braga. He was the organizing chair of ETAPS'07, The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software, organized in Braga in 2007, and the worksho co-chair of ICSE'24 held in Lisbon.<br><br>

## Thursday November 7
Auditorium B

* 08:30 Day opens (with coffee, tea, croissant, and wienerbrød)
* 09:05 Keynote, Chair: Fritz Henglein<br>
  <b>Sam Staton</b><br>
  <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;" >_Programming theory meets statistical modelling_</span>
  <span style="display: none;"><br>
    <b>Affiliation:</b> University of Oxford, UK<br>
    <b>Abstract:</b>  I will discuss the idea that concepts from programming theory have a role to play in statistical modelling. Indeed they are already playing this role to some extent, but in different guises. These concepts include abstract types and lazy data structures, as well as more theoretical ideas such as effect gradings, monoidal indeterminates and sheaf categories. So I will present some opportunities for using programming theory to inform and formalize the abstract structure of statistics and probability, including some recent and ongoing results from myself and collaborators. I won't assume much familiarity.<br>
    <b>Biography:</b> Sam is a professor of Computer Science in Oxford. He has previously worked in Nijmegen, Paris and Cambridge. The talk will be based on work funded by the ERC grant "BLAST: Better Languages for Statistics" and the ARIA Project "Employing categorical probability towards safe AI".<br><br>

  <b>Martin Berger</b><br>
  <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;" >_Towards GPU-accelerated automated reasoning_</span>
  <span style="display: none;"><br>
    <b>Affiliation:</b>University of Sussex & Montanarius Ltd<br>
    <b>Abstract:</b> Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the work-horses of high-performance computing. The acceleration they provide to applications compatible with their programming paradigm can surpass CPU performance by several orders of magnitude, as notably evidenced by the advancements in deep learning. A significant spectrum of applications, especially within automated reasoning—like SAT/SMT solvers—has yet to reap the benefits of GPU acceleration.  In this talk we discuss recent work that successfully implemented program synthesis on GPUs and used it to accelerate learning of logical specifications from examples.  We conclude by mapping out a research programme to move more formal verification workloads to GPUs.<br>
    <b>Biography:</b> Martin Berger did his PhD in formal models for distributed systems at Imperial College. He's currently an associate professor in the Department of Informatics at the University of Sussex.  He's also working as a verification consultant for the microprocessor industry, and is one of the maintainers of the official RISC-V instruction set architecture (<a href="https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv" target="_blank">https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv</a>).  His research interests include: logic and verification, typing systems, process calculus, meta-programming, JIT compiler.<br><br>
