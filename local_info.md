# Travel

For participants from Sweden, there are several direct trains or busses to Koebenhavn H.

For other international participants, you can fly to Copenhagen Airport (CPH).

The airport has a direct connection to the centre (Nørreport) by Metro (15 minutes) and by train to the main station (København H).

Cheaper hotels close the main station (København H) and on Islands Brygge. However, this is a 45-minute walk or 20-25 minutes with public transport from the venue. E.g.:

# Local transport
In Copenhagen you can use metro, busses, S-trains (local trains), and regular trains on the same ticket.

Planning local public transport can be done with Google Maps or the local <a href="https://help.rejseplanen.dk/hc/en-us/articles/115002672449-Rejseplanen-s-app">Rejseplanen app</a>.

When entering metro, S-trains and trains, you must have a valid ticket already. If you don’t have one you can get a fine of 750 DKK (100 EUR). Tickets can be bought in one of the following ways:
- At tickets machines at the stations (card or cash)
- With bus drivers on busses (cash only)
- With the <a href="https://www.publictransport.dk/app">DOT Tickets App</a> (RECOMMENDED)
- Getting the local <a href="https://www.rejsekort.dk/en/bestil/rejsekort-anonymt">Rejsekort Anonymous</a>

## DOT Tickets App
For a stay of only a few days, we highly recommend the DOT Tickets App. In the app you can choose the number of zones from the current location. 

Travel from the airport to the centre is 3 zones (from Zone 04 through Zone 03 to Zone 01). Valid for 90 minutes. Price 30 DKK.

Travel inside the centre is 2 zones starting from Zone 01. That is the minimum number of zones you can buy. Valid for 75 minutes. Price 24 DKK.

## Rejsekort Anonymous
The Rejsekort Anonymous is cheaper (10% normally, 30% in evenings), but you need to get it from a retailer. You can find these at the Main Station or Nørreport station. There is none at the airport. You must deposit 80 DKK for the card, that you can get back when you return it.

With the Rejsekort you don’t need to calculate zones, but have to check in when you start the trip (blue dot stands with green “check in” label) and check out when you finish (similar with red “check out” label).
