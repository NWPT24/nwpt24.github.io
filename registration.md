## Instructions
* Choose "Regular" on the first sign-up page unless you are a PhD, Master's or bachelor's student enrolled at an accredited university. 
* Fill the form and click "Continue". Unless you want to add more.
* Read the conditions, check the "I have read..." box, "I accept that I will receive emails regarding NWPT", and continue.
* Fill the invoice information. If you know your university's EU VAT number, fill it into the CVR field on the 'Orderer' page; if not, don't worry about it. (The VAT number may help your university recover Danish VAT included in the registration fee.) Choose "Email invoice" (unless you are employed at UCPH). Read and accept conditions, and continue.

You will get a registration confirmation and will subsequently get up-to-date information about NWPT 2024 by email.
