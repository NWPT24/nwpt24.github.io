## About NWPT

NWPT is a series of annual regional-scope workshops on programming
theory, targeted especially at younger researchers. In 2024, the
workshop will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark. We hope this will be
a nice opportunity to present recent results and/or work-in-progress,
and to meet colleagues from the Nordic and Baltic countries. We
encourage PhD students and postdocs to contribute. Topics of interest
include (but are not limited to):

- semantics of programming languages
- programming language design and programming methodology
- programming logics
- formal specification of programs
- program verification
- program construction
- tools for program verification and construction
- program transformation and refinement
- real-time, hybrid/cyber-physical systems modeling and verification
- models of concurrency and distributed computing
- model checking
- model-based testing
- language-based security.
