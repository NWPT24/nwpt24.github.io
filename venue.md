The historic Auditorium is ideal for lectures, awards ceremonies and small conferences.

If walls could speak, the beautiful old Auditorium on Øster Voldgade would tell a myriad of stories about the countless scientific discoveries that have been presented in this classic venue. The large windows, the abundant light and the stunning views of the Botanical Garden make it a unique venue for meetings. Guests enter via the colourful stairwell rotunda, decorated by the famous Danish artist-cum-geologist, Per Kirkeby.
