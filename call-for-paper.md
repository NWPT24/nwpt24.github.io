## Scope
NWPT is a series of annual regional-scope workshops on programming theory, targeted especially at younger researchers. In 2024, the workshop will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark. We hope this will be a nice opportunity to present recent results and/or work-in-progress, and to meet colleagues from the Nordic and Baltic countries. We encourage PhD students and postdocs to contribute. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * semantics of programming languages,
  * programming language design and programming methodology,
  * programming logics,
  * formal specification of programs,
  * program verification,
  * program construction,
  * tools for program verification and construction,
  * program transformation and refinement,
  * real-time, hybrid/cyber-physical systems modeling and verification,
  * models of concurrency and distributed computing,
  * model checking,
  * model-based testing,
  * language-based security.

## Submission guidelines
Authors wishing to give a talk at the workshop are requested to submit abstracts of 2-3 pages (pdf, printable on A4 paper, typeset with LaTeX with easychair.cls) through EasyChair:
